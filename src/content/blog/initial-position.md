Now I'm sitting here. With a glass of red wine, I Ã­nspiried to get started. Inspired by Ali Abdaals podcast episode "[How To Start Your First Business in 48 Hours - Noah Kagan](https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/deep-dive-with-ali-abdaal/id1587142091?i=1000643529570)". The trigger to finally get started and start with **execution** was exactly this episode I listened to when I was going for a walk after a workday in my company, where I work as a frontend developer. I knew someday would be the day where I needed to sit down and start >something<. In essence, it does not matter what you start with, it is important that you get the f*** going.

**That was my lecture for 2024.**

I can't emphasize enough how important this first blog post is to me and my career as a future entrepreneur. I procrastinated for such a long time by reading one book that tells me how to get started after the other, reading blog posts on mass, listening to podcasts, you name it. But at a certain point, it was not preparation (what is that even when you want to start a business?), it was not filling gaps of knowledge, it was procrastination. Procrastination and the fear of showing my work, stepping into new territories like marketing, idea finding, validation, etc. My comfort zone kept me well in place while I was dreaming of becoming an entrepreneur.

This blog is my first public expression of my creativity in the form of text. With Produnaut, I'd like to share tips, tricks, and personal experiences where I have the feeling that they could help people and feel a connection with the struggles and thoughts I have and will have along the way.

I'm so ready to get started, I'm so ready to face the fear, and I'm so ready to explore myself through becoming an entrepreneur. Becoming an entrepreneur is not only about creating your own cosmos around your life, earning good money, and supporting people with their problems. Entrepreneurship is also a way of deep self-development. That's at least what I'm convinced of. Getting into situations where you have to step out of your box over and over again, feeling uncomfortable, seeling stuff at people, and getting rejected. Why should one do that? Because at the end, it will be worth it, and you will live a life of fulfillment and joy in every area you can think of.

Now, let's lift off & join the journey ðŸš€
